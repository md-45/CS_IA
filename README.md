How It's Made:
Tech used: Python (MatPlotLib, Pandas), Swift (SwiftUI), HTML

I wanted to develop a time management app for International Baccalaureate students to effectively balance their school and personal lives. I utilized a Swift-based iOS interface and a Python backend for data analysis and storage using libraries like Matplotlib.

Lessons Learned:
I learned how to have interoperable Python and Swift, combine two data structures, configure system files, configure environmental variables, utilize property wrappers, and use unwrapped optionals. Additionally, I learned how to design and report on a programming project.
